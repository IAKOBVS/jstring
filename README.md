Features:
<br>
will work with any string type (takes a pointer to string, size, and cap)
<br>
string replacement;
<br>
regex replacement;
<br>
etc.
<br>
<br>
Functions:
<br>
_p: returns a pointer to the new end of the passed string.
<br>
_f: assumes that there be enough space: it will not grow the string.
<br>
_now: compiles passed regex_t.
<br>
_constexpr: use when passing arguments known at compile-time.
<br>
E.g., rplcall_constexpr(&s.data, &s.size, &s.cap, "hello", "world").
<br>
Since "hello" and "world" are literal strings whose length are known at compile time, the compiler can pick the appropriate function based on the length, potentially resulting in smaller code size.
<br>
<br>
Scripts:
<br>
./build: generate additional functions
<br>
./clean: delete files generated by ./build
<br>
./renamespace: replace the namespace in generated by ./build in ./c and ./cpp
