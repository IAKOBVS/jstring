Features:
<br>
will work with any string type (takes a pointer to string, size, and cap)
<br>
string replacement;
<br>
regex replacement;
<br>
etc.
<br>
<br>
Functions:
<br>
_p: returns a pointer to the new end of the passed string.
<br>
_f: assumes that there be enough space: it will not grow the string.
<br>
_now: compiles passed regex_t.
<br>
_constexpr: use when passing arguments known at compile-time.
<br>
E.g., replaceall_constexpr(&s.data, &s.size, &s.cap, "hello", "world").
<br>
Since the search string, "hello", and the replace, "world", is a literal string, and its length known at compile-time, the compiler can pick the appropriate function based on the length, resulting in smaller code size.
<br>
<br>
