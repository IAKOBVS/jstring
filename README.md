## Features:
- works with any C string: functions will take a pointer to string, size, and capacity.
- in-place string replacement
- in-place regex string replacement
- reverse standard string functions: strrstr, strrspn, etc.
## Installation:
```
sudo ./install
```
and
```
#include <jstr/jstr.h>
```
## Function affixes: 
- *_mem(): takes the length of the string
- *_p(): returns the new pointer to the end of the string
- *_f(): assumes that there be enough space in the string: it will not grow it with realloc
- *_now(): compiles regular expression now
- P*() or p*(): private functions
## Scripts:
- install: builds and copies all the header files to /usr/local/jstr (requires sudo)
- uninstall: removes /usr/local/jstr (requires sudo)
- clean: removes files generated by build
- fmt: formats code
