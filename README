---- jstring

--- Features:
- works with any string type: Functions take a pointer to string, size, and capacity.
- in-place literal string and regex replacement: Supports backreferences and
searching from a specified index.
- reverse standard string functions: memrchr(), strrstr(), strrspn(), strrcspn(),
etc.
- standard string functions for non-nul terminated strings: Memspn(), memcspn(),
mempbrk(), etc.
- extensions to standard string functions: strnstr(), strnchr(), strcasestr_len().
- string formatting: asprintf() and vsprintfstrlen(), which returns the maximum
number of characters (not the exact number) vsprintf will write including the nul.

--- Installation:

//
./build && sudo ./install
#include <jstr/jstr.h>
//

or

//
./build && ./install-to /path/to/some/dir
#include "/path/to/some/dir/jstr.h"
//

Some headers may need to be explicitly included because they rely on POSIX.

--- Disclaimer:
Some of the code are licensed under LGPL. You can define JSTR_USE_LGPL as 0 to exclude them. jstr_ty, jstrl_ty, and
jarr_ty must be initialized with zeros.

//
jstr_ty j = JSTR_INIT;
//

--- Error handling:
JSTR_ERR is returned as error. The programmer is expected to check the return value
and handle the error. When a memory error is encountered, the user is expected to free
all the related resources. Use jstr_err() to print the error message or jstr_errdie()
to also exit. When debugging, you may want to define JSTR_PANIC as 1 to automatically
call jstr_errdie() on errors.

--- Naming conventions
-- Functions or macros:
- *_mem*(): The string need not be nul-terminated.
- *_len(): Take the length of the string.
- *str*_len(): The string passed to this function must be nul-termimated.
The size parameter is only used to potentially save a strlen().
- *stp*(), *_p(), *P(): Return a pointer to the end of the string.
- *_unsafe(): Assume that there be enough space in the string: The string will
not be grown.
- *_from(): Operate starting from a specified index. The index passed by the user
is assumed to be within bounds.
- *_bref(): Enable backreferences for the replacement string. \0 is interpreted
as referring to the whole matched string.
- *_at(): Return an element of from an array type. When JSTR_PANIC is defined as
1, do a bounds check at runtime.
- *_chk*(): Evaluate to true if the value passed is an error value.
- *_err(): Print an error message.
- *_errdie(): Print an error message and exit().
- [Pp]namespace_*(): Internal functions.
